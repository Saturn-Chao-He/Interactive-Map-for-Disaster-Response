This is the official demo code for [[Paper]](https://www.mdpi.com/). 

We develop a disaster response system that can read social media data and do post classification, then visualize the info on map.

## 1. Download Dataset
**Dataset** : 
[[HumAID]](https://crisisnlp.qcri.org/humaid_dataset)

Alam, F.; Qazi, U.; Imran, M. HumAID: Human-Annotated Disaster Incidents Data from Twitter with Deep Learning Benchmarks. ICWSM 2021, 15, 933â€“942, doi:10.1609/icwsm.v15i1.18116.

## 2. Model Training

Create Python environment and install the required packages using Conda:
```bash
conda create --name ModernBert python==3.8
conda activate ModernBert

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Our Trained Model
**Our trained Model is uploaded to Huggingface** : 
[[Huggingface]](https://huggingface.co/)

## 3. Model Training

Run the training script:
```bash
python train.py



```

## 4. Model Deployment and Visualization on Map


You can deploy it using [[Nginx]](https://nginx.org/)
```bash
# Deploy a cloud server and get a public IP address:
# run nginx
# run the script for reasoning
python3 pridict.py

Open browser and visit https://your-public-ip-address
```

You can test it using python http server
```bash
# run http server
python3 -m http.server 8000

# run the script for reasoning
python3 pridict.py

Open browser and visit https://localhost:8000
```
